               <p>Hobo Joe lives with seven other animals:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>3 cats</li>
                   <li>3 dogs</li>
                   <li>A turtle</li>
               </ul>
               <p>He really only considers the cats to be his friends,
                   but because he prefers to be alone, this is just barely. He thinks of himself more as the king of the castle,
                   and everyone else must bow to him &#40;not that they actually listen&#41;. He spends a lot of time just observing the other animals, like a king 
                   observing his royal subjects.

                    <dt>Castiel</dt>
                    <dd>Castiel, named after Castiel from Supernatural, is a year older than Joe, 
                        though he acts half his age. Cas is incredibly talkative and will meow as loud as possible when you enter a room with him. Most of
                        his talking is just asking to be pet, though sometimes it's because he's the spokesperson for the food dishes. He's a sweet little angel
                        and gets along with every human he meets. He and Joe met when my family lived in Georgia, and they've learned to tolerate each other.

                    <br>
                    <dt>Shrimp</dt>
                    <dd>Shrimp is about three years old and was born to a stray cat during a hurricane. He's the only cat in the house that's allowed outside,
                        which makes Joe incredibly jealous. He goes in and out of the house as he pleases, spending his time inside sleeping and eating and his time
                        outside on patrol and eating some more. He's gotten fat in the past few months, fatter than what Joe used to be. He doesn't just meow, he
                        squeaks and chirps as if he's still a little kitten. Shrimp mostly minds his own business, but he gets along with Joe the best out of
                        the others. They can occasionally be found sharing a bed or chair, though they usually keep a minimum of two feet apart.

                    <br>
                    <dt>Boo</dt>
                    <dd>Boo is only eight months old but has defined a clear place in the family. Like Shrimp, she was born to a stray, and it's very likely
                        the two of them have the same father. The other three generally don't like her because for a while she got a lot of attention.
                        Shrimp had the hardest time getting used to her and would lash out because he was no longer the baby of the house. He got over himself
                        once he realized we still love him and he'd still be getting the same amount of attention. Boo used to be incredibly vicious and would
                        attack anyone and anything at any given time. She has since mellowed out and learned that if she sits still and looks pretty, she'll
                        get her head scratched. She's obviously the most energetic of all the cats because she's still little and likes to spend her mornings 
                        racing around the house. The rest of the day she either sleeps or sits directly in front of my right monitor and swats at my cursor
                        on my left monitor &#40;thank you Boo for all your &ldquo;help&rdquo; in the making of this project&#41;.
